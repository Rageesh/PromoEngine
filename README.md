Problem Statement: Promotion Engine
Implement a simple promotion engine for a checkout process. Our Cart contains a list of single character SKU ids (A, B, C. ) over which the promotion engine will need to run.

The promotion engine will need to calculate the total order value after applying the 2 promotion types:|

buy 'n' items of a SKU for a fixed price (3 A's for 130)
buy SKU 1 & SKU 2 for a fixed price ( C + D = 30 )

The promotion engine should be modular to allow for more promotion types to be added at a later date (e.g. a future promotion could be x% of a SKU unit price). For this coding exercise you can assume that the promotions will be mutually exclusive; in other words if one is applied the other promotions will not apply

Test Setup
Unit price for SKU IDs:
A 50
B 30
C 20
D 15

Active Promotions:
3 of A's for 130
2 of B's for 45
C & D for 30

Scenario A
1 * A 50
1 * B 30
1 * C 20

Total 100

Scenario B
5 * A 130 + 2*50
5 * B 45 + 45 + 30
1 * C 28

Total 370

Scenario C
3 * A 130
5 * B 45 + 45 + 1 * 30
1 * C -
1 * D 30

Total 280

Notes
â€¢ The promotion rules are mutually exclusive, that implies only one promotion (individual SKU or combined) is applicable to a particular SKU. Rest depends on the imagination of the programmer for which scenarios they want to consider, for example (case 1 => 2A = 30 and A=A40%) or (case 2 => either 2A = 30 or A=A40%)

Solution: PromotionEngine
.Net Core 3.1 application, implemented in C#, using Visual Studio 2019.

Projects

PreSetData
This .net core library contains the Data which is required for the implementation of the promotion 
this contains  Order Data , Product Catalogue, Prmotional Rules Data

Promo Engine 
This Console application which is used to invoke and chech the Promotional Engine via console

PromotionalEngine

This .net Core Library implements the promotional agaist the Order data based on the Promotional Rules Settings which is defined in PreSetData
and Calaculated the final cart value 
 

Currently only 2 types are implemented:

ApplyCombinedProductPromo
ApplyMultiProductPromo


Usage
Add SKUitems (if needed) - In PreSetData  ProductCatalogue file
Add Promotions, in PreSetData PromotionData file - Can Give Promotion SKUID in PromSKU, Count and offer Price for MultyBuy Promo Scheme Or Product SKUIDs and Offer Price in Combined purchase Scheme.
